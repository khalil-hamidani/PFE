    <h1>Personal cyber issue</h1>
    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>If you believe a cyber incident is an imminent threat to life or of a criminal nature, please contact your local police services. We
        encourage all victims to report cybercrime activities to law enforcement.</p>
    <h2>Before you report:</h2>
    <p>You are reporting as an individual. It will take you approximately 5 minutes to complete.</p>
    <p>Please make sure you have the following details ready before you start:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Details of what happened, including dates and any financial transactions made</li>
        <li>The victim’s gender, date of birth and contact details</li>
        <li>Whether the victim is willing to make a formal statement</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Your report is important:</h2>
    <p>By reporting, you will be helping to stop other people from falling victim to the same issue. Your report will also assist the
        Algerian Cyber Security Centre and law enforcement agencies to disrupt cyber-crime operations and make Algeria the safest place to
        connect online.</p>
