    <h1>Government cyber issue</h1>
    <h2>Before you report:</h2>
    <p>You are reporting a cybercrime that has happened to a government department or agency. It will take you approximately 10 minutes to
        complete.</p>
    <p>Please make sure you have the following details ready before you start:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Details of what happened, including dates and any financial transactions made</li>
        <li>Whether the victim (i.e. someone from the government department) is willing to make a formal statement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your report is important:</h2>
    <p>Your report will be passed to law enforcement agencies for assessment and intelligence purposes. You may be contacted by police if
        additional information is required. Please note: not all reports will be investigated by police, but all reports are important as
        they provide information on the latest cyber-crime activity and trends.</p>
    <p>By reporting, you will be helping to stop other people from falling victim to the same issue. Your report will also assist the
        Algerian Cyber Security Centre and law enforcement agencies to disrupt cyber-crime operations and make Algeria the safest place to
        connect online.</p>

    <h2>You should NOT report when:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>there is already a complain order against the suspect</li>
        <li>a physical crime has been committed, such as your debit or credit card or computer has been stolen</li>
        <li>ou have received a scam call and no loss of personal information or money has occurred</li>
    </ul>
